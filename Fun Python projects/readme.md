# Python Utility Scripts


This repository contains two Python scripts:

* **`Automatic file sorter.py`**: This script automates the process of organizing files within a directory. It sorts files into predefined folders based on their file extensions (e.g., .csv to "excel sheets", .jpg to "photos").
* **`BMI Calculator.py`**: This script calculates Body Mass Index (BMI), Waist-to-Height Ratio, and BMI Prime. It takes user input for name, weight, height, and waist measurement, then provides corresponding health assessments.
