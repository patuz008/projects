# Heart Disease Prediction Project

This Jupyter Notebook (`Heart disease prediction.ipynb`) contains a data analysis and machine learning project focused on predicting the risk of heart disease.

**Key Features:**

* **Data Exploration:** Includes steps to load, clean, and visualize the dataset to understand its characteristics and identify potential patterns.
* **Feature Engineering:** May involve creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve model performance.
* **Model Building:** Implements and trains one or more machine learning models suitable for binary classification (predicting the presence or absence of heart disease).
* **Model Evaluation:** Assesses the performance of the trained model(s) using appropriate metrics.

**To Use This Notebook:**

1.  Ensure you have a Python environment with the necessary libraries installed (e.g., pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn).
2.  Open the `Heart disease prediction.ipynb` file using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
3.  Run the cells sequentially to execute the code and reproduce the analysis and model training.

This project provides a practical example of applying data science techniques to a healthcare prediction problem.
